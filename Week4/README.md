Data set can be found on kaggle from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arevel/chess-games and https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankurnapa/brewery-operations-and-market-analysis-dataset/data. Currently the sorter is set to sort the chess data I would like to get some input as to how I could have made the data analyser classes more generic such that it could plot and find the values for any instead of for a specifik one like it is now
